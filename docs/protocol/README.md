# Zerion Protocol Specifications

This directory documents the protocols that Zerion defines and implements. It
covers the wire formats, the cryptographic constructions, and the message flow
for each layer of the stack.

The protocols described here are Zerion's own work. They run on an application
engine whose lower-level plumbing, namely the local database, identity storage,
the plugin and lifecycle machinery, and the Tor onion wrapper, is code derived
from
the Briar/Bramble codebase (GPLv3), re-homed under `org.zerionproject`. Zerion's
protocols replace or sit above that inherited code; where a document refers to an
inherited engine component it says so. See the Attribution section of the
[README](../../README.md).

## Protocol stack

Zerion runs one message stack over three interchangeable carriers.

```
  Application records (ZMM)
        |
  Session crypto:
    - online  : ZWF stream + Mode 3-Full ratchet      (ZWF-MODE3FULL.md)
    - offline : Async Sealed-Sender envelope           (ASYNC-SEALED-SENDER.md)
        |
  Delivery:
    - online  : ZTP transport + ZPP pull rhythm        (ZTP-ZPP.md)
    - offline : Mesh flooding over Bluetooth Low Energy (MESH-TRANSPORT.md)
        |
  Carriers:
    - Tor v3 onion services            (inherited onion wrapper, see ZTP-ZPP.md)
    - Bluetooth Low Energy             (MESH-TRANSPORT.md)
    - Embedded I2P, optional           (EMBEDDED-I2P.md)
```

The online path and the offline path use different session crypto because they
have different trust and timing models. Online, both peers are present and hold a
long-lived shared root key, so Zerion runs a continuous forward-secret ratchet.
Offline, the recipient may be absent for days and messages are relayed by
untrusted devices, so Zerion seals each message to the recipient's published
prekey bundle with no interactive handshake.

## Cryptographic primitives

All layers share one primitive set.

| Purpose | Primitive |
| --- | --- |
| Authenticated encryption | XSalsa20-Poly1305, 24-byte nonce, 16-byte tag |
| Key encapsulation (post-quantum) | ML-KEM-768 |
| Key agreement (classical) | X25519 |
| Signature (post-quantum) | ML-DSA-65 |
| Signature (classical) | Ed25519 |
| Hashing and key derivation | SHA-256 and SHA-512 based KDF and MAC |

Public keys and signatures are hybrid: a classical key concatenated with a
post-quantum key, so a break of either family alone does not break the
construction. Sizes are listed in each document and are fixed by
`PostQuantumConstants` and `PcsConstants`.

## Conventions

Byte layouts are shown as field tables with fixed offsets. Integers are
big-endian unless stated otherwise. Lengths are in bytes. A field written as
`name:N` is N bytes wide; `name:uintK` is a K-bit big-endian unsigned integer.
